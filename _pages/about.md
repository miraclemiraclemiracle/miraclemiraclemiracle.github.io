## About Me

I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics, Peking University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pengcheng You](https://pengcheng-you.github.io/desires-lab/people.html), who leads [DESIRES Lab][https://pengcheng-you.github.io/desires-lab/] at the School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics, Peking University. Prior to that, I acquired my Bachelor’s degree majoring in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics（Scientific and Engineering Computation, at the College of Engineering, Peking University. 

My email is x [at] y [dot] cn (x="yixuanliu2024", y="stu.pku.edu"). Feel free to contact me for any discussions and potential collaborations.

## Research Interests
My current research focuses on **control and optimization theory** for the stability and efficiency of modern power systems. Specifically, my work involves the analysis of **[frequency synchronization and stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_frequency)**, as well as how these physical-level dynamics can be integrated with **[electricity markets dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05811)**. 

Additionally, I am also exploring the applications of **Reinforcement Learning** with theoretical guarantees.
